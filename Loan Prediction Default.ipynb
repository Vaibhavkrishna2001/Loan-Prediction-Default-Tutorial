    "Any machine-learning or neural-network technique we have covered so far in this course is acceptable. If you wish to challenge yourself with something we haven't covered yet, that is also okay, but consider whether you are able to do it justice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since these topics are broad, you will want to focus on one particular aspect to master. For example, you might want to take a detailed look at how different kernels change the behaviour of SVM, or do a deep dive on how a Multilayer Perceptron's performance changes with the depth or width of the network. Remember, however, that your objective is to teach others about how this works so that they might be able to use it in their own work. "

    "Ans: The Machine Learning technique which i have chosen for this project is \"Random Forest\". I am focusing on how the number of trees(n_estimators)impact the model performance and overfitting. An ensemble learning technique called Random Forest uses several decision trees to increase accuracy; nevertheless, in order to maximize accuracy while avoiding overfitting, it is essential to comprehend how the number of trees and model performance relate to one another."

    "### Overview of Random Forest:\n",
    "Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm because it requires labeled data to train the model. It will use the multiple decision trees to make the predictions. This model can be used for both classification and regression. Classification: Classification refers to when the variables are categorical such as predicting loan default: 'yes' or 'No'. Regression: Regression refers to when the variable is continuos such as predicting house prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why we are using Random Forest algorithm over other machine learning algorithms?\n",
    "l It is incredibly accurate and runs efficiently on large data bases.\n",
    "2 It can effectively correct errors in class population unbalanced data sets.\n",
    "3 It supports an efficient method for estimating missing data that can maintain accuracy even when a significant portion of the data is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Impact of Number of Trees on Performance and Overfitting:\n",
    "Impact of Increasing n_estimators: Increasing the number of trees tends to make the model more robust, lowering variance and bias. Adding more trees, however, eventually results in diminishing returns. The model becomes saturated, and the performance advantage begins to level out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Performance Plateaus: The model may underfit the data if there are insufficient trees. Performance stabilizes and gets better as the number of trees rises. More trees may still result in slight gains in training accuracy but not in test accuracy after a certain point.\n",
    "\n",
    "overfditting: Even though Random Forest lessens overfitting when compared to a single decision tree, overfitting is still possible, particularly when using deep or very big trees. Additionally, if the model is too complicated or has too many trees, it may overfit and memorize training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Considerations for Tuning n_estimators:\n",
    "Computational Cost: Balancing the number of trees is important as increasing n_estimators can give high accuracy but also increases the trainig time and memory usage(Computational cost).\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-validation: The best n_estimators can be found by using cross-validation. This gives a more accurate approximation of the model's performance in the real world and guarantees that it doesn't overfit on the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning: We can tune parameters such as max_depth, min_samples_split in combination with n_estimators for better performance of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "Random Forest is a potent ensemble learning method that combines several decision trees using bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) to improve model performance. This method averages outputs across several trees, which lowers overfitting, increases accuracy, and guarantees reliable forecasts.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this study we focused on how increase in n_estimators impacts on model performance and overfitting. To implement this we are going to train and test the model accuracy. identifying the optimal number of trees by maintaining accuracy, computational cost, and overfitting risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the use of this analysis, we hope to show that although adding additional n_estimators generally increases model stability, there comes a point at which performance is no longer meaningfully improved by doing so. An ideal balance between bias and variance can be achieved by carefully adjusting this parameter, guaranteeing a well-generalized model for loan default prediction."
